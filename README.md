PointDistanceCalculator
Description

PointDistanceCalculator is a Python script that calculates the distance between two points in a 2D plane using the distance formula. This simple program demonstrates basic geometric computations.
Features

    Input coordinates for two points.
    Calculates the Euclidean distance between them.
    Outputs the distance formatted to two decimal places.

Usage

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/PointDistanceCalculator.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd PointDistanceCalculator

Run the script:

bash

    python point_distance_calculator.py

    Follow the prompts to input the coordinates of the two points.

Example

plaintext

(x , y) coordinates for point P : 
3
4
(x , y) coordinates for point Q : 
7
1
distance between P and Q :  5.00

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    math module (standard library)
